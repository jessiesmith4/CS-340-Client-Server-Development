__How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?__

<H6>
        Writing programs that include comments to effectively describe the purpose, the way it is used, what it does,
etc. helps me create programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable. Following best practices, and keeping the functions short and to the point allowed me to create CRUD functions that are reusable. I can use my CRUD function in the future by simply changing the username, password, and imported files.

__How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?__
<br/>
<H6>
     I made sure that I fully understood the requirements and tried multiple different things when created the dashboard requirement that Grazioso Salvare requested. This project took a bit more research aside from the provided resources in the class for me to fully understand how to meet all of the requirements, which is to be expected in the real world. To create databases to meet other client requests, I will continue to research and try multiple different approaches in order to figure out the best approach.

__What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?__
<br/>
<H6>
        Computer scientists create software based solutions in order to increase the effectiveness of their clients. In this case, Grazioso Salvare needed a database that was easier to read, filter, and use. The dashboard I created allows a user to read the database without being in a command prompt or directly using MongoDB, the user can select different animals listed on the page and see where they are as well as their breed, id number, etc., and the list can be filtered by rescue type. This allows the users to easily and effectively access the database.
